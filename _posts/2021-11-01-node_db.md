### PASSWORD 플러그인을 설치할 것인지
VALIDATE PASSWORD COMPONENT can be used to test passwords

and allows the users to set only those passwords which are   
secure enough. Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD component?   

Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No: n   
Please set the password for root here.

### 익명 사용자 접속허용 여부 설정 'y'시 접속시 -u옵션 반드시 명시해야함
By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user,   
allowing anyone to log into MySQL without having to have   
a user account created for them. This is intended only for   
testing, and to make the installation go a bit smoother.   
You should remove them before moving into a production   
environment.   

Remove anonymous users? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y   
Success.   
  
<br>

### 외부 접속 허용여부
Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from   
'localhost'. This ensures that someone cannot guess at   
the root password from the network.   

Disallow root login remotely? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : n   

 ... skipping.

By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that

and should be removed before moving into a production   
environment.
